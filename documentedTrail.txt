27: p1 checks flag[0] == 0 and it is positive and gets directly interrupted
28: p0 sets flag[0] and 
29: p0 enters critical section because turn == 0 is still true
30: p1 sets turn = 1 and
31: p1 enters critical section
--> both processes in critical section
32: p1 checks turn == 1 which is true because he set it last
33: p1 leaves critical section
34: p0 checks turn == 0 and notices an assertion failure
